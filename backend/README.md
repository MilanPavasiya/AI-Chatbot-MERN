# AI Chatbot Application

## Overview

This project is a custom AI-powered chatbot application inspired by ChatGPT. It is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack and integrates OpenAIâ€™s powerful language model. 

The chatbot allows users to interact with an AI in real-time, and features secure storage of user conversations, including the ability to retrieve and delete previous messages. Security measures such as JWT tokens, HTTP-only cookies, signed cookies, and password encryption ensure that user data is protected.

## Features

- **Customizable Chatbot:** Powered by OpenAI's language model, delivering intelligent and dynamic responses.
- **User Message Management:** User messages are stored in a MongoDB database, and users can retrieve or delete their messages as needed.
- **Security Features:** 
  - JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication.
  - HTTP-only cookies and signed cookies for additional protection against XSS attacks.
  - Password encryption using industry-standard hashing algorithms.
  - Middleware chains that handle authentication, authorization, and data validation.
  
## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js, Axios
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI API
- **Security:** JWT Tokens, HTTP-Only Cookies, Signed Cookies, Password Encryption

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this application, you will need the following installed:

- Node.js (v14+)
- MongoDB (local or cloud)
- OpenAI API Key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-chatbot-mern.git
   cd ai-chatbot-mern
   ```

2. Install server dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

3. Install client dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

1. **Backend Configuration:**  
   Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add the following environment variables:

   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/myDB
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```

## Application Structure

### Backend (Node.js & Express.js)
- **`app.ts`**: Entry point for the server and routing.
- **`routes/`**: Contains API routes for handling user activities, CRUD operations, etc.
- **`models/`**: MongoDB models for users and messages.
- **`db/`**: Database connectivity.
- **`controllers/`**: Handles the logic and action methods for each API route.
- **`utils/`**: JWT token, HTTP-only cookies implemented for authentication, validation, and error handling.
  
## Security Considerations

This application uses the following security measures to ensure data protection:
- **JWT Tokens:** Secure user authentication and authorization.
- **HTTP-Only Cookies:** Prevent access to cookies via JavaScript, mitigating XSS attacks.
- **Signed Cookies:** Add tamper protection to cookies, ensuring integrity.
- **Password Encryption:** All user passwords are hashed using bcrypt before being stored in the database.
- **Middleware Chains:** Middleware functions handle authentication, authorization, input validation, and more.

## Future Improvements

- **User Roles and Permissions:** Introduce roles such as admin or moderator for advanced message management.
- **Multi-language Support:** Extend AI capabilities to respond in multiple languages.
- **Real-time Notifications:** Notify users when their messages are successfully stored, retrieved, or deleted.
- **AI Training:** Allow users to provide feedback that helps improve the AI model over time.
